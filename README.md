COMP 3370 Assignment 2 Simulator program
======================================

Assignment 2 Simulator program and output file
------------------------

This directory contains simulator.cpp and should produce simulator.out after invocation of "make"

To run the test file's , please use the command below

    ./simulator.out <code.o> <memory.dat>


I did not use preprocessor directives as I emailed Franklin and he explicitly told us it was not 
a must. To test my program with different cache_blocks and different block_sizes, please open
"simulator.cpp" and the number of cache blocks is defined as #define CACHE_BLOCKS and the 
block size is defined as #define BLOCK_SIZE . You can change the CACHE_BLOCKS and BLOCK_SIZE 
on line 40 and 43 to any value for testing and recompile the source code with an invocation of 
"make".


Thank you! I hope you enjoy marking this :)
